## Inspiration
I'm hungry. I don't know what to eat and I would like to know what other short simple meals UCR students are enjoying.
## What it does
You can add your own recipes and have it displayed on the website.
## How I built it
I built it using React.js and used Firebase to store all of the recipe data.
## Challenges I ran into
Definitely a huge time restraint as I felt like I didn't have enough time to fully implement everything I wanted.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Firebase implementation with React.js was a huge goal for me. Using the Firebase server for storing recipes was something I didn't know I could learn/do by myself.
## What I learned
React.js was difficult to learn but it took some time to fully get familiar with the framework. 
## What's next for Hungry Highlanders

- Better styling for the webpage
- User Login (to prevent deleting other peoples recipes)
